# Functional-Reasoning

## Overview

The physics-based reasoner is a tool used to validate the structure and function of electromechanical systems represented in SysML. By parsing the modelâ€™s exported XML file, the reasoner applies a series of physics-based inspections which reflect real-life physical principles. Violations of these inspections will be detected by the reasoner and displayed as a graphical user interface (GUI).
